				"Just read the book “Praise the Great Beholder!”. It’s about Chezdrur the beholder, a flawless character who ends up easily killing the tarrasque in a great battle. It was written by a cult who worships Chezdrur, who is real but hasn’t even seen the tarrasque from afar.",
				"One winter it was so cold that the dawn froze solid. The sun normally rose between two mountains, but the ice had built up so much that it stuck firmly in place. The first sunbeams of the day had frozen up like golden icicles. A ranger named Dav Oket was coming home from a successful night hunting with a fresh owlbear. Seeing the sun frozen in place, and being a smart man, Dav knew he had to do something quickly or the world would plunge into chaos. He swiftly sprinted up the frozen sunbeams and used the heat of the owlbear carcass to melt the ice. Dav gave the sun a kick to dislodge it, lit his pipe on the sun, and slid down the sunbeams with the owlbear right to his front door. He even kept a bit of the sunrise in his pocket to remember the occasion.",
				"If you travel to Owlbear Lake on a quiet day, you might just catch a glimpse of The Monster. It looks like a great brown snake 90 feet long, with two huge ears coming out the sides of its head and jaws large enough to swallow a man in one gulp! Some say it has hundreds of small legs that make it kind of skitter across the ground, but it can swim faster than a horse can gallop. Sometimes it sneaks up on swimmers, and if it's not hungry it just pulls them under and lets them go. Of course old Dav Oket heard about this monster and bet his friends that he could take it on. After days of stalking, Dav finally had a shot with his bow. He was a crack shot, but not an arrow found its mark. The Monster scuttled forward and ate Dav's bow! So the ranger wrapped his arms around the beast and wrestled with it. The fight was so great, so colossal, that it stirred up a storm over the lake. Finally, Dav threw the Monster over his shoulder, and it sailed right over the mountain. To this day, you can cross the lake in safety if you call out, \"Old Dav's a-coming!\" and the Monster swims away to the bottom of the lake.",
				"Lady of Pain! The lady who had so many piercings and self inflicted curses she rattled and smoked with every movement.",

				"You haven't heard of Kim the Great and his stories? It is said that at the age of 9 he had slain a dragon alone to protect the people of his land, with his bare hands, using no magic. Out Great Leader Kim truly is a gift from the gods",
				"Ebrius \"the drunk\" once drank the entire ocean after his ale fell in it. Impressed by his resolution the gods proclaimed him the \"Lord of the drunkards\". It's true, you can ask him yourself, he's probably in the tavern right now. (Just has a godlike bluff, advantage if the person he's talking to is drunk too).",
				"Centuries ago, there was a dark mage, Daffy, the Implacable. He summoned another moon, and named it Majorus. It was going to fall on the world, and destroy all of it, but it turned out the \"moon\" was just too close, making it seem big. So, a group of adventurers threw fireballs at it, and Majorus burned down. Daffy was never seen again.",
				"There once was a boy, called Brightus. It's said he made a heavier-than-air machine, that could fly without magic. He rode what was called \"The Airplane\" out of a cliff, as a crowd watched him fly it into the unknown. Legend says Brightus will one day return, giving flying machines to everyone.",
				"It's said the Great King (intentionaly vague) had a younger brother, who wanted to take the crown at all costs. So, he made deals with several demons, and got enough power to kill everyone but his brother in the kingdom, replace them with minions, and get rid of all the evidence. Legend has it the original King was magically paralysed and made invisible before all that happened, and had to watch as his brother destroyed everything and took his identity.",
				"There once was a deaf woman with a ridiculous name. So ridiculous, in fact, that whoever heard it laughed to death. She caused death everywhere he went, and eventually got her hearing defficiency cured by an also deaf cleric. So, she heard her name, and laughed to death.",
				"Ever hear the tale of Rutmod the Sunderer? Legend says Rutmod won two dozen rounds of gladitorial combat, and severed the arms of every single combatant that fought that day. The strangest part is, he started with his own!",
				"Legend tells of a man by the name of Throckmorton, who would only traverse the land on a board with several small wheels attached to it. He would flip this board around in a dizzying display of finesse, and could propel himself faster than any sprinter. No man or beast could touch him. One day, Throckmorton grew bored of this plane, and propelled off of a ramp upwards into the heavens themselves, where he performs his tricks to this day.",
				"Before the ancients took hold in the land there was a legend that defied the rules of logic. Its said that in The Ethereal Highlands there lived a young lady named Megaera. Rumor has it that she was raised by clan of giants who had never seen a human before. One day, Megaera wondered too far away from the giants encampment, and entered the dark forest. Megaera sent several days lost in the woods afraid and starving. There was dragon larking in the shadows then suddenly it flow out of the darkness penning Megaera to the ground. Hopelessness dawned on Megaera as the dragon opened its jaws ready for a fest. The dragon's piercing teeth bit into Megaera as she was eaten alive, screams began to go numb the fur down she went into its stomach. Death was assured for Megaera. Then something happened, the dragon began to roar violently in pain. Megeare was more than a mer mortal, she was the offspring of t Eztia, Goddess Of Destiny. Megaera short ripped the dragon a part from the inside out, however, she left the wings intacted so she could meld with them in order to fly into the heavens.",
				"Have you heard the tale of Nublig the goblin chronomancer? Long story short he was his own grandfather.",
				"Long ago there was an Elf and a Dwarf who competed at everything to see who was better. One day they asked a Druid to turn them both into trees to see who was the better tree and the Druid obliged. The Elf became a tall elegant oak and the Dwarf became a tiny fir tree, however, since neither could speak to request to be changed back they became stuck that way. They propagated and now there are short sturdy pine trees all over the Dwarf mountains and tall oaks throughout the Elven kingdoms.",
				"The first globe map was created when a Beholder flew up enough to see the entire world and then lost his eye on the way down.",
				"There was once a love so strong between two people that if you stood between them one side of you would feel ice, and the other straight fire.",

				"The tribes of kzechem sacrifice their people at the same spot. This has been a tradition for thousands of years.",
				"Tarrasques are so big that their white blood cells fell of and became coconuts. Their red blood cells then became strawberries.",
				"Thrain was so strong already at birth that when a deadly plague came to kill him and his family, he tore apart the evil spirit with his little baby hands. Saving his kingdom.",
				"And then the Goliath swung his great sword at the king's head. He cleaved with such a fierce blow the head went flying. It flew for miles, falling into a rabbit hole. That's how we came up with golf.",
				"According to eyewitnesses the king of the elves was seen on a shield, going downwards on a slope filled with dead bodies, He then turned with his beautiful archery skills the hill/mountain into a bloodied one. That's why this is called blood slope/blood mountain.",
